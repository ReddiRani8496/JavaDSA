What is data structure?
Data structure is way to store,manage data. So that data can be accessed easily.

Time Complexity:

1. Constant Time O(1)
2. Logarthimic   O(log n)
3. linear        O(n)
4. linearthimic  O(nlogn)
5. Quadratic     O(n^2)
6. Exponential   O(2^n)
7. Factorial     O(n!)


Space TimeComplexity:
Extra space taken to complete the program.

What is algorithm?
step-by-step approach or process to solve a problem or complete a task.

Example:

To Prepare Tea.

-> Take bowl
-> pour milk
-> After burning milk add tea powder
-> After some time add sugar
-> Tea is ready


Flow Chart:
---------
Pictorial representation of the problem is called flowchart.

Oval -> start/end
parallelogram -> input/output
rectangle -> process
diamond -> decision making
arrows -> flow 

Recursion:
---------
A method calling itself is called recursion.
