programming languages based on the abstraction:

1. Low level -> Machine Code, binary Code, Assembly language

2. High level -> Python, Java



What is Programming Language?

Ans: To communicate with a person we need a specific language, similarly to communicate with computers,
programmers also need a language called programming language.

It is a set of instructions written in any language.

1.Machine Language:
------------------
-> Machine language is a type of low level language.
-> It is a series of 0s and 1s
-> No translation is needed.

2. Assembly Language:
---------------------
-> It is a low level language it is designed for specific processors.
-> It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human understandable form.
-> It uses Assembler to convert Assembly language to Machine language.

3. High Level Language:
----------------------
-> It uses compiler or interpreter to convert high level language to Machine Language.

Types of programming language:
-----------------------------
1.Procedural Programming Language:
--------------------------------
-> List of instructions given to computer, what to do in step by step.
-> It divides program into small procedures called routines or functions.
-> It is also called structured programming.
Ex: FORTAN, C

2. Functional Programming Language:
----------------------------------
-> It is an approach for problem solving.
-> It treats every computation as mathematical function.
-> It allows you to write mathematical function, i.e., a function that takes n arguments and returns a value.
Ex: Python, Haskel.

3. Object Oriented Programming language:
---------------------------------------
-> Object Oriented programming is based on the objects, programs are divided into objects.
-> It binds the related data and functions into an object and encourages the reuse of these objects within same program or different program.
Example: Java


4. Statically Typed Language:
----------------------------
-> Performs type checking at compile time.
-> Declaration of datatype is compulsory.
Example:
------
int a = 10;
a = "abc"; // error it will allow only integer.

5. Dynamically Typed Language:
----------------------------
-> Performs type checking at run time.
-> no need to declare datatypes.
Example:
-------
a=10;
a="abc";
